## Project Title
Credit card checker
## Description
This was part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. Here was the background information: "The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time." There were then more details on functionality we should programme. We used the Luhn algorithm.
